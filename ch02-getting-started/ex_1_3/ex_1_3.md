## Linear search - a proof of the correctness using loop invariants

Our loop invariant is the imaginary (but not complex mimaginary)
variable `v`: it always takes one of two possible values: either
`None`, or the `index` at which the key was found.

1. Before the start of the loop, we assign to the `v` the value
`None`. The invariant is vacuously (or trivially) true.
2. During the execution of the loop, the `v` can take the value of an
int if and only if the key has been found. When that happens, we
return from the function immediately. The `v` keeps the int value of
the `index` and so the loop invariant holds in this case also.
3. If nothing has been found in the process of executing the *for*
loop, the `v` keeps the initial value of `None`. The invariant is
satisfied.

Considering all of the above, the loop invariant is always true, which
guarantees the correctness of the algorithm.
