## Linear search - a proof using loop invariants

Our loop invariant is the variable `v`: it always has either the value
of `None`, or an integer value of `index` at which the key was found.

1. Before the loop we assign to `v` the value `None`. The invariant is
vacuously (or trivially) true.
2. During the execution of the loop, `v` can take the value of an
*int* if and only if the key has been found: `v = index`. When that
happens, we return from the function immediately. `v` keeps the *int*
value of the `index` and so the loop invariant holds in this case
also.
3. If nothing has been found in the process of executing the *for*
loop, `v` keeps the initial value of `None`. The invariant is
satisfied.

Considering all of the above, the loop invariant is always true, which
guarantees the correctness of the algorithm.
