## Space and time complexity of the linear search algorithm

In the best case, the algorithm needs to check only the first element;
in the worst, it has to go through the whole list, hence the time
complexity is `O(len(list_to_be_searched))`. The average case amounts
to scanning `n / 2` elements.

Both average- and worst-case running times of the linear search are
`Theta(len(list_to_be_searched))`. In the asymptotic notation,
constant factors don't play any role in determining the time
complexity class.
